## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br> 
A women-centered, beginner-friendly hackathon with a Generative AI theme. We emphasized explainable, reproducible demos over flash, paired every team with mentors, and created multiple guided on-ramps so first-timers could ship in 24 hours.  

- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
• Gemini 101 workshop with Google Developers Group @ Penn  
• Talks from Prof. Chris Callison-Burch, Prof. Pratik Chaudhari, Prof. Zack Ives (UPenn)  
• Industry speakers from Meta AI (Jiani Wang) and Amazon AI (Neha Narwal); Google Developer Experts Roya Kandalan and Allen S. Firstenberg  
• Skills clinics by Penn Labs, Wharton Undergraduate Data Analytics Club, and Crack the Code @ Penn  
• 10 award categories recognizing impact, first-time hackers, accessibility, GenAI use, and more  

- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br> 
• Teams used Git + GitHub for version control and collaboration; mentors reviewed work via PRs/issues.  
• Devpost submissions required a GitHub repo link so judges could verify commit history, READMEs, and reproducibility.  
• We ran intro content on Git/GitHub in our beginner tracks so first-timers left with working repos.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
  Workshop materials/printing; beginner-track rooms; food to keep teams onsite; small prize support and swag.

  The grant funded capacity for newcomers, enabling 20 completed projects (12 GenAI); mentors used GitHub issues/PRs for actionable feedback; judges reproducibly evaluated via READMEs and commit history. Overall, the grant helped us keep the event inclusive and ship-focused rather than demo-only.
